# DesmosClone
This is one of the projects I have been working on for the school bagrot of computer science (+5 units).
I decided I want to make an app works like desmos, it draws the functions you give to it.

I thought I was going to use JavaFX for the visuals, but then I decided that I am going to switch to Android Studio and I am currently learning it.
