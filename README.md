# DesmosClone
This is one of the projects I have been working on for the school bagrot of computer science (+5 units).
I decided I want to make an app works like desmos, it draws the functions you give to it.

I thought I was going to use JavaFX for the visuals, but then I decided that I am going to switch to Android Studio and I am currently learning it.
The project is not yet finished.

Also I switched to using a different database for the project --> FireBase, so this project became DEPRECATED though it is a really good entry point for most databases and is well written.
